## 1. Executive Summary

AgriSense AI is a cloud-native, agentic AI platform designed to empower farmers with real-time agricultural intelligence. The platform combines weather monitoring, AI-powered crop diagnosis, agricultural news aggregation, and a community marketplace — all orchestrated by autonomous AI agents running on AWS.

The system leverages an **agentic AI architecture** where specialized agents autonomously gather data, make decisions, and take actions on behalf of farmers — proactively alerting them to weather risks, diagnosing crop issues from photos, curating relevant news, and facilitating community interactions.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Farmers face significant challenges:

- **Unpredictable weather** causes crop loss due to lack of timely, localized alerts.
- **Crop diseases and pest damage** go undiagnosed until it's too late — access to agronomists is limited and expensive.
- **Information fragmentation** — agricultural news, market prices, and best practices are scattered across many sources.
- **Isolation** — farmers lack a dedicated community platform to share knowledge, ask questions, and trade goods locally.

---

## 3. Product Vision

> A single AI-powered platform where farmers receive proactive weather alerts, get instant crop diagnosis from a photo, stay informed with curated agri news, and connect with a thriving farming community — all powered by autonomous AI agents.

## 4. Feature Requirements

### 4.1 Weather Intelligence Agent

**Description:** An autonomous agent that continuously monitors weather data for the farmer's location and proactively sends alerts.

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| W-01 | Display 7-day weather forecast with hourly breakdown | P0 |
| W-02 | High temperature alert (configurable threshold, default >35°C) | P0 |
| W-03 | Low temperature alert (configurable threshold, default <5°C) | P0 |
| W-04 | Flood risk alert based on rainfall accumulation and regional data | P0 |
| W-05 | Drought/dry weather alert based on consecutive dry days and soil moisture | P0 |
| W-06 | Push notifications (mobile) and SMS alerts for critical weather events | P0 |
| W-07 | Location-based auto-detection with manual override | P1 |
| W-08 | Historical weather data and trend visualization | P2 |
| W-09 | Agent autonomously correlates weather patterns with crop calendars and provides actionable recommendations (e.g., "Delay planting by 3 days due to incoming frost") | P1 |

**Agentic Behavior:**
- The Weather Agent runs on a schedule (every 30 minutes), fetches forecast data, evaluates alert thresholds, and autonomously decides whether to notify the farmer.
- It learns farmer preferences over time (crop type, region, sensitivity levels).
- It can chain actions: detect flood risk → check farmer's crop type → generate tailored mitigation advice → send alert.

---

### 4.2 Crop Diagnosis AI Chatbot

**Description:** A multimodal AI chatbot that accepts text and photo uploads to provide instant diagnosis of crop diseases, pest damage, nutrient deficiencies, and abiotic stress.

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| C-01 | Text-based conversational chatbot for agricultural questions | P0 |
| C-02 | Photo upload capability (camera capture and gallery upload) | P0 |
| C-03 | Instant diagnosis of plant diseases from photos (< 5 seconds) | P0 |
| C-04 | Pest damage identification and treatment recommendations | P0 |
| C-05 | Nutrient deficiency detection (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) | P0 |
| C-06 | Abiotic stress identification (heat, drought, waterlogging, salt) | P0 |
| C-07 | Multi-turn conversation with context retention | P1 |
| C-08 | Diagnosis confidence score and severity rating | P1 |

## 5. Agentic AI Architecture

### 5.1 Agent Orchestration

The platform uses an **orchestrator-worker pattern** where a central orchestrator agent delegates tasks to specialized worker agents.

```
                    +-------------------------+
                    |   Orchestrator Agent     |
                    |  (Amazon Bedrock Agents) |
                    +-------------------------+
                     /     |       |        \
                    v      v       v         v
             +--------+ +------+ +------+ +-----------+
             |Weather | |Crop  | |News  | |Community  |
             |Agent   | |Diag  | |Agent | |Agent      |
             |        | |Agent | |      | |           |
             +--------+ +------+ +------+ +-----------+
```

### 5.2 Agent Capabilities

Each agent has:
- **Autonomy:** Can make decisions and take actions without human intervention.
- **Tool Use:** Agents can call APIs, query databases, invoke Lambda functions, and use other AWS services.
- **Memory:** Agents maintain conversation history and user context via session state.
- **Planning:** Agents break complex requests into sub-tasks and execute them step by step.
- **Collaboration:** Agents can delegate to or consult other agents (e.g., Diagnosis Agent asks Weather Agent for recent conditions to refine diagnosis).

## 9. User Journeys

### Journey 1: Weather Alert
1. Farmer registers and sets location + crop type.
2. Weather Agent detects incoming heavy rainfall (flood risk).
3. Agent correlates with farmer's rice paddy crop → generates tailored advice.
4. Farmer receives push notification: "Heavy rain expected in 6 hours. Risk of flooding in your area. Recommended: check drainage channels and delay fertilizer application."
5. Farmer taps notification → opens app with full forecast + action checklist.

### Journey 2: Crop Diagnosis
1. Farmer notices yellow spots on tomato leaves.
2. Opens chatbot → takes a photo → asks "What's wrong with my tomato plant?"
3. Diagnosis Agent analyzes the image → identifies **Early Blight (Alternaria solani)** with 92% confidence.
4. Agent responds with: diagnosis, severity (moderate), recommended fungicide treatment, organic alternatives, and prevention tips.
5. Three days later, agent proactively asks: "How is your tomato plant doing? Would you like to share a follow-up photo?"

### Journey 3: Community Marketplace
1. Farmer has surplus organic fertilizer to sell.
2. Posts listing in AgriCommunity marketplace with photos and price.
3. Nearby farmers see the listing in their location-based feed.
4. Interested buyer sends a direct message → they negotiate and arrange pickup.
5. Community Agent suggests the post to farmers who recently asked about organic fertilizers.
